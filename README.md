# LinkTree
This is my Linktree. Developed as a widget with Blockchain Operating System on Near Protocol. 

The linktree services online usually require premium subscription to add background, remove banners or change the font color. In addition to that, they can decide to erase the data, or sell it to data brokers. Seeking personalization and data ownership, I developed my personal Linktree, deployed with Near Protocol.
